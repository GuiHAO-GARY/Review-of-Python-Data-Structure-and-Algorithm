# Review-of-Python-Data-Structure-and-Algorithm
One study review and documentation of self-learning data structure and algorithm using Python

Since my major in university was statistics, I lack basic knowledge of computer science such as data structure and algorithm. 

With desire to dive into vivid data science world, I decide to learn Python, machine learning and deep learning by myself. However, one and another failure during job interview coding assignment made me realize the importance of foundation of computer science. 

Thus this repository serves as a learning note of Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures Using Python 2nd edition as well as some assignments solution in exercise parts. Hope this repository record and witness my progress during journey towards data science.
